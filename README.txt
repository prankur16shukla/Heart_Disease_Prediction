## Project Introduction
In this Classification Machine Learning Project, we will be analysing the dataset taken from www.kaggle.com related to details of patients. This data consists of features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure and many more. Our focus will be on analysing the data, getting the insights related to these features and there role in affecting the target we will perform feature engineering, feature selection and develop a Classification model that will predict whether the patient has a heart disease or not.
